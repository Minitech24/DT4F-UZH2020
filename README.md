Digital Tools For Finance UZH2020
Repository for our final project in Digital Tools For Finance at the University of Zurich Fall 2020


We analyse returns of two stock based portfolios and compare these with the Swiss Market Index. 
The main criteria for portfolio creation are the average beta values of each indiviudal stock contained in the SMI during the years 2005-2007.
High and low beta portfolios are then built containing 5 stocks each and are held for 10years until the end of 2017. 

We present results in a R Markdown file as well a short paper and presentation both written with LaTeX.

The main goal of this project is to properly use various IT tools commonly used in todays research.
