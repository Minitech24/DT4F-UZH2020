Repository for the final project for the lecture Digital Tools for Finance.

For our project we analyse returns of two stock based portfolios and compare these with the Swiss Market Index. 
The main criteria for portfolio construction are the average beta values of each indiviudal stock contained in the SMI during the years 2005-2007. High and low beta portfolios are built containing 5 stocks each and are held for 10years until the end of 2017. The data used include monthly stock returns of all SMI titles that have existed way back to the year 1988 as well as Swiss Government Bonds and SMI returns, collected in Datastream and Bloomberg.

We present results in a R Markdown file and in a short paper and presentation which are both written in LaTeX.

The main goal of this project is to make use of various IT tools wich are commonly used in todays research.
