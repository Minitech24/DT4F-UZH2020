Fall 2020  

Repository for the final project for the lecture Digital Tools for Finance.

For our project we analyse returns of five stock based portfolios and compare these with the Swiss Market Index. 
The main criteria for portfolio construction daily beta values of each indiviudal stock contained in the SMI during the years 1994-2007. Five portfolios are built that differentiate by their quintile beta values. These portfolios are rebalanced on a daily basis until the end of 2017. The data used include daily stock returns of all SMI titles that have existed way back to the year 1988 as well as SMI returns, collected in Datastream.

We present results in a R Markdown file, and in a paper and presentation which are both written in LaTeX.

The main goal of this project is to make use of various IT tools wich are commonly used in todays research.  

The following steps were pursued:  
1. Creating Github repository  
2. Set up git with RStudtio and connect to Github Repository  
3. Collect data from Datastream  
4. Establish SQL Database for collected data  
5. Start with research project   
    - data access for both MySQL and CSV files  
    - major calculations  
    - plotting results  
6. Polish RMarkdown for interactive use  
7. Start write up in LaTeX  
8. Finish with presentation in LaTeX
