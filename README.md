Repository for the final project for the lecture Digital Tools for Finance.

For our project we analyse returns of five stock based portfolios and compare these with the Swiss Market Index. 
The main criteria for portfolio construction daily beta values of each indiviudal stock contained in the SMI during the years 1994-2007. Five portfolios are built differntiated quintile beta values and contain 5 stocks each. These portfolios are rebalanced on a daily basis until the end of 2017. The data used include daily stock returns of all SMI titles that have existed way back to the year 1994 as well as SMI returns, collected in Datastream.

We present results in a R Markdown file and in a short paper and presentation which are both written in LaTeX.

The main goal of this project is to make use of various IT tools wich are commonly used in todays research.
